Try out your game by running `npm start`. If you've written your functions
correctly, it should all work!

Look over the code in [`index.js`](./index.js), where we create the store,
and then subscribe a couple of functions that do the work of (1) printing
the board, and (2) asking for user input. We'll need to extend this code
in the next section, when we add winner validation.
